                        <strong>Indian Constitution</strong> was written after independence under <strong>Dr. Rajendra Prasad</strong> who later became India's First President. The Indian Constitution is unique 
                        in both spirit and content. It is the <b>Supreme Law of India</b>. It lays down all the 
                        <strong>proceedings, fundamental political code, structure, powers, and duties of government institutions and sets out fundamental rights, directive principles, and the duties of citizens</strong>. 
                        We should be proud for our <b>Constitution as it is the longest written 
                        constitution of any country on earth till date</b>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The constitution declares India a
                        <strong>sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic</strong>, assuring its citizens <strong>justice, equality and liberty</strong>, 
                        and endeavours to promote fraternity. The words <b>"secular" and "socialist"</b> were added to the preamble in 1976 during the Emergency. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The original 1950 constitution is preserved in a <b>helium-filled case at the Parliament House in New Delhi</b>. The Constitution was ready by <b>26 November 1949</b> but it was
                        made effective from 26 Jan 1950 inorder to make the day historical so that future generation could remember the day of <b>Poorna Swaraj of 1930</b> when Independence was 
                        celeberated for the first time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The constitution was drafted by the <b>Constituent Assembly</b>, which was elected by elected members of the provincial assemblies. The <b>389-member assembly (reduced to 299 
                        after the partition of India)</b> took almost three years to draft the constitution holding eleven sessions over a <b>165-day</b> period. 
                        B. R. Ambedkar was a wise constitutional expert, he had studied the constitutions of about 60 countries. Ambedkar is recognised as the <i>"Father of the Constitution 
                        of India"</i>. He was the Chair Person of Drafting Commiee.

                    <p>
                        There were several problems during making of National Constitution for the country with Freedom. These problems were:
                        <ol><li>The partition of the country happened on the basis of religious differences. It proved to be a traumatic experience for the people of both the countries 
                              (India and Pakistan) which also led to the killings of at least 10 lakh people.</li>
                            <li>The British left it to princely states to ascertain whether they wanted to merge with India or with Pakistan or remain independent. The merger looked like 
                              a difficult and uncertain task.</li> 
                              <li>These problems created anxiety for the makers of the constitution regarding the present and the future of the country. Therefore, during drafting of the 
                              constitution, the future of the country looked insecure.</li>
                              <li>India and Pakistan were already on War for the Kashmir Province from Oct 1947 well known as First Kashmir War. </li>
                                <li>There was demand within the assembly to frame states on the basis of languages spoken, so a committee(jvp) was framed to look into this matter and 
                              committee decided not to go ahead with linguistic division(with the fear that this may led to Sub-nationalism) finally the assembly left the decision up to the 
                              future parliament.</li>
                              <li>As the country had already witnessed communal violence during partition so the another main aim of the assembly members was how to design a constitution that 
                              can ensure the prevention of communal violence in future.</li>
                              <li>Assembly had to protect the interest of the minorities and the backward & exploited class and so had to frame the constitution with their interest.</li>
                                <li>The members of assembly were not free to take up decission untill new constitution of Independent India was ready. They regulated by british government. 
                              The people of india were emerging from states of Subjects to the status of Citizens with lot of Freedom. </li>
                              <li>There were areas like Daman And Diu and Goa which were not yet independent. Such areas started getting independence but it could not be mixed with the provinces 
                              and so idea of Union Territories was advocated. Finnally by 1961 all the present territory of India was made an Integral Part Of The Country.</li>

                                    On Sept 02 1953, Dr. BR Ambedkar in the Rajya Sabha spoke this words:<br>
                                    <q><i>My friends tell me that I have made the Constitution. But I am 
                                      quite prepared to say that I shall be the first person to burn 
                                      it out. I do not want it. It does not suit anybody. But whatever 
                                      that may be if our people want to carry on they must not forget 
                                      that there are majorities and there are minorities and they simply 
                                      cannot ignore the minorities by saying, “Oh, no. To recognise you 
                                      is to harm democracy.” I should say that the greatest harm will 
                                      come by injuring the minorities.</i></q></li>

                               <p>We should be proud of The Indian Constitution and should always respect and follow its laws, enjoy fundamental
                                 rights and yes, follow your Fundamental Duties. As a youth, he/she has to do this to make the country develop and take
                                 through the skies. This is not only for Defence Examination or UPSC Exams but for life long skills.
